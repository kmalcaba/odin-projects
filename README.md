# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors project from The Odin Project

Status: Currently in progress. The script runs the game purely in the console, but I plan on improving on this by adding an interface with React. Maybe I could convert this into the Fire Emblem weapon triangle...

Techniques used: (as of 13/05/2022)

- Access objects to quickly select rock, paper, scissors values into its corresponding integer values
- Use `Math.random()` to generate the computer's selection
- Use `switch` and `if` statements to determine the winner in a round
- Use `while` loops to indefinitely loop until either the player or computer reaches a score of 5
- Use template literals to output scores and results into the console
- Use `alert()` and `prompt()` functions to show and receive feedback to the user.
